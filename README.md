ALLOCATE：Adaptive Learning of optimaL-transpOrt-based Cell AlignmenT and Evolution 

ALLOCATE advances optimal transport by explicitly modeling key characteristics of temporally evolving cellular systems, improving the corresponding assignment probabilities. It also provides interpretability for the potential of cellular growth and death, enabling a quantitative description of developmental and disease dynamics.

## Installation
We will soon make ALLOCATE available on PyPi. In the mean time, you can download the repository and call the functions directly.

## Contact
If you encounter any problem running the software, please contact Jiaxin Chen at cjx_bio@sjtu.edu.cn
